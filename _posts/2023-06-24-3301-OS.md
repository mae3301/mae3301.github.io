title: Exploring the 3301 OS 
---

TLDR: The Cicada Operation System seen in the 2013 challenge is nothing more than Tinycore 4.7.2 plus six extra files.

Longer Version: 

If you don't know what the Cicada 3301 puzzle is, you can get caught up at the excellent fandom wiki. Currently I'm looking at the
remaining unsolved piece of the puzzle, the yet-to-be-decrypted "Liber Primus."

I'm new to the Cicada 3301 puzzle and like many newcomers have had high hopes for an easy find. Of course if finds were
easy the Liber Primus would have been de-crypted already! Still, I thought I would document my first foray into turning over
rocks, since I don't think this exact journey has been traced online yet. My goal is to document my process so that it can be reproduced, at least on a comparable environment (I am running linux, specifically Ubuntu 22.04).  I also provide a bash script with many of the commands I ran at the terminal and the python script I used to do more intensive analysis. 

One of the creative parts of the 2013 puzzle I admire is the introduction of a clue in the form of an operating system. It is known that it is based on the Tinycore operating system, a small form of linux often used in embedded systems. Information in the os was used to reach the next stage of the puzzle. Still, since an entire os was involved, I thought maybe there were files that hadn't yet been found and might provide new information. Or maybe there was some source of corruption in the operating system itself.  Looking at the files and binary of a small OS seems in line with other challenges in the cicada playbook.  

My first step was to get a copy of the file containing the operating system, as well as some other materials. You can download it here:  The md4sum checksum is . 

Next I loaded up the the 3301 OS using virtualbox. I found the version it purported to be with the following command:

Finally, I explored the running system and found the files that Cicada is known to have added. Below is a chart showing their names, locations, size in kilobytes, and date updated. The files have date stamps slightly after December 27, 2012, where a cursory inspection shows that other files in the operating system have date stamps of December 27, 2012.  The files all played a role in the 2013 challenge, whereas the two identical files wisdom and folly do not seem to have been used for anything (yet).

Traveling over to the Tinycore website, I downloaded the 4.7.2 release for comparison. According the message board, this release was first made available on December 22, 2012. At that point the maintainer was releaseing a new minor version every month or so.   My actual process involved some trial and error looking through the different ISO options, but file size ultimately makes it clear Cicada used the core option.

To compare the two operating systems I needed to extract, unzip, and un-archive the core files from each ISO. For these tasks I used the command line tools isoutil, gunzip, and cpio respectively.  Note: cpio is an archiving and un-archiving tool that is an alternative to the more common tar.  If you have the two iso images in a folder called , the following commands should do the trick.  

Next, I used a python script to enumerate both filesystems recursively and compare them.  First of all I found that the only difference files by file name were the six that are already comman knownledge. Next I performed a comprehensive comparison all files of the same name, using the md4sum as a method. I found that all the common files were the same, with the exception of tc-config.  Here I ran a diff on the two files and found the following change. I am honestly not sure of the reason behind it. However, I am pretty confident it's not a clue.

Zooming out a bit, I used the command isoutil to add to the check I just performed.   We can see the story of how Cicada created the operating system. They downloaded the code on Decemberi 27, 2017, updated it during the next several days by adding the known files, and re-archived, re-zipped, and remade the image. The day they completed the image was the day they kicked off the 2013 round of puzzles on the 4chan boards /x/ and /b/.

My conclusion is that there are no more hidden files in the operating system and that it was a quick and straightforward creation once the puzzles themselves had been chosen and reflected in the known files. It is of course possible that wisdom/folly has some future use, but that's about it.
